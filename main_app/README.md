## EZBay

I attempted to reverse-engineer eBay as it is a website I use very frequently to browse and shop. This was the most challenging project I have tackled so far.

## Wireframes

1. Main page - https://www.figma.com/file/AtvUQbCLXiWAoHy6q5erjQ/main-page?node-id=0%3A1
2. Show page - https://www.figma.com/file/NJ6F1U7PW9mGPbhIfOBur3/show-page?node-id=0%3A1

## User Stories

User will be able to navigate to the site and can expect a similar layout to eBay on the main page. User will be able to click on listings and see the listing details, are able to scroll through the various images, and can filter the listings.

Three key features for our MVP:
1. Carousel images for the listings
2. Filtering products
3. Viewing the products as well as the product details

## User Flow

I got eBay's search API functional (with help from instructors) but had to scrap it and restart the project due to many issues I encountered along the way. I will definitely refactor this project back to the API and get it working.

Another implementation I wanted to get working was refactoring the front-end to React instead of Django full-stack.

Being able to filter the listings was something I really wanted to get to too and will definitely revisit this project.

## Database Models/ERDs

Database Models:

1. User model
2. Listings model

ERDs:

User to Listings - One to many relationship.

## Summary

Kevin: This was my toughest project yet. I was messing with the eBay search API for 3 days and it really stunted the progress of my project, which is why I reverted back to a database last second. I am definitely going to revisit this project.
